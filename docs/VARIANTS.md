# Build Variants

Deekseep 1.7.1 publishes two stable APKs. They compile the same canonical
feature core and differ only in the Xposed entry interface and packaging.

## Selection Guide

| Directory | 1.7.1 release asset | Framework target | Package ID |
|---|---|---|---|
| `module/` | `deekseep-stable-api102-v1.7.1.apk` | Current LSPosed with libxposed API 102 | `com.dsmod.probe` |
| `module-legacy/` | `deekseep-stable-legacy-v1.7.1.apk` | Traditional Xposed API 82+, including compatible FPA/older LSPosed environments | `com.dsmod.probe` |

Use the API 102 build on a current LSPosed installation. Use the legacy build
only when the framework cannot load modern libxposed metadata.

## 1.7.1 Feature Parity

Both release APKs are built from `module/src/com/dsmod/probe` and therefore
contain the same stable and opt-in experimental functionality:

- settings entry, prompt injection, response preservation and diagnostics;
- account import/export with strict server validation;
- refreshed cross-account chat editor, search, export, statistics and backup;
- local conversation/image persistence, native navigation and deletion;
- regional native-login restoration controls;
- OpenAI Chat/Responses and Anthropic Messages local gateway;
- Codex and Claude Code tool-result loops and conversation isolation;
- the optional **Experimental Features** page, short one-time usage note and
  separate experimental help.

Features in the Experimental Features page remain off by default and are not a
stability guarantee. See [Experimental Features](EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES.md).

## Test Editions Are Discontinued

Starting with 1.7.1, the former `module-inject/` and
`module-inject-legacy/` test editions are discontinued and receive no GitHub
Release APKs. Their direct Compose settings injection and host long-press menu
experiments were too dependent on obfuscated UI internals to maintain as public
parallel products. The separate `module-mtest/` load probe is also excluded
from the 1.7.1 release.

The historical source directories remain for archaeology and comparison, but
they are not built by `scripts/build-all.sh`, not covered by the 1.7.1 release
tests, and must not be presented as supported downloads. Experimental end-user
features that remain maintained now live behind the dedicated page in the two
stable APKs.

## Interface Packaging

The modern APK:

- extends `io.github.libxposed.api.XposedModule`;
- receives packages through `onPackageLoaded`;
- declares its entry in `META-INF/xposed/`;
- compiles against libxposed API 102 without packaging the API classes.

The legacy APK:

- implements `IXposedHookLoadPackage` through a generated compatibility entry;
- receives packages through `handleLoadPackage`;
- declares `assets/xposed_init` and traditional manifest metadata;
- compiles the canonical stable core through the traditional Xposed callback
  adapter under `module-legacy/compat`;
- does not package the compile-only `de.robv.android.xposed` stubs.

## Signature and Switching Rules

Both stable APKs use `com.dsmod.probe`, but the local modern and legacy build
scripts use different development keys. Android can reject an in-place switch
because the signatures differ. Disable and uninstall the current module APK
before installing the other interface; this does not uninstall DeepSeek.

Enable only one Deekseep implementation for `com.deepseek.chat`. Duplicate
hooks can rewrite the same request or database row twice and are unsupported.
Release keys are local and excluded from Git, so a build made on another
machine may likewise require uninstalling the previous APK.
