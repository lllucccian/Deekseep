# Stable API 102

This is the recommended Deekseep project for a current LSPosed installation.

Current release: **1.7.2**.

- Package: `com.dsmod.probe`
- Interface: libxposed API 102
- Metadata: `META-INF/xposed/`
- Output: `ds-probe.apk`
- Public asset: `deekseep-stable-api102-v1.7.2.apk`

It contains the broadest maintained stable feature set, including the advanced
chat editor with live refresh, persistent blank local conversations, direct
user/AI row appending, gallery image persistence and existing-image reuse,
the current-source chat wallpaper and multi-sticker layout editor with
crop focus, background-only depth, and curved unified/per-screen
sidebar/settings motion,
1.7.1 reasoning creation, repair and duration support,
reasoning-aware native chat search, local data tools, sidebar multi-select, and
the current expert image relay port. It also includes independent opt-in switches
that restore DeepSeek's own Google Credential Manager entry on the mainland
login screen, or restore the native WeChat and SMS/mobile entries together on
an overseas login screen. Modern activation uses the official Xposed service
provider and a separately UID-validated heartbeat from the DeepSeek process.

This build additionally contains the local API gateway under a gated
Experimental Features subpage alongside expert image relay. First entry requires a
five-second risk confirmation and has separate help. The manually drawn API control
page exposes a persistent enable switch, actual URL, copy/custom/rotate Key actions,
a current-format row with an OpenAI/Anthropic picker, live queue and failure
statistics, Chat/Responses/Messages non-stream and SSE support, deep-thinking
parameters, Codex/Claude Code tools, and a module foreground keeper for Android's
Cached Apps Freezer. All completions share one fair account-wide native generation
permit; tool-bearing main/Task turns receive priority, while reusable hidden sessions
are isolated by workload plus a hashed client UUID/conversation-root scope so
`/clear` and `/new` start clean branches without returning to session-creation 429s.
Anthropic message/thinking events begin only after native upstream collection starts. OpenAI
Responses additionally tracks Codex thread/session metadata, emits current `phase`, `end_turn`,
and custom-tool status fields, and keeps encrypted transport items out of model context.

The traditional 1.7.2 APK compiles this same canonical feature core through
`module-legacy/compat`; the former test editions are no longer published.
